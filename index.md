I am a computer engineering major here at CSUF and I am planning to graduate in 2029.

## Favorite CSPC 120 Labs

* Lab 6, part 2 
I liked this lab because I feel like this was when I really started to understand functions and “if” statements. Both were used heavily as we made a function that played the game blackjack. This lab also taught me how to call functions, so you don’t have to write the same code over and over again. 

* Lab 3, part 1 
I liked this lab because although it was more introductory, I feel like I was really able to apply myself in this lab. I liked how we integrated formulas into the function in order to get it to print out the BMR of men and women and how to input each part. This lab also helped me better understand the concept of doubles. 

* Lab 7 
This lab challenged my way of thinking and gave me a new perspective on the way I see things, but also figuring out how code is written. When it came to doing the “if” and “else” statements, I really had to think about how to make them work accurately, whether it was making something less than, greater than, equal to, or anything except certain numbers. The number of conditions also helped me to work on my formatting skills.
